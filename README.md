# php-circuit
First try of circuit built with PHP 

The circuit is a programming paradigm based on the following: 
1. All can be seen as a structure 
2. Structure consists of elements and connections between them 
3. Even a simple element, withiout any inner elements, is a structure, you just call it a simple one 
4. There are 3 types of elements: 
    1. Nodes are key elements of the structure
    2. Entry points are used to make connections between structures 
    3. Empty fields are optional and can be used to define subtypes. You can fill it in with a structure
